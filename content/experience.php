                            Long term cooperation as a subcontractor.
                            My responsibility was to create whole websites based on Wordpress CMS.
                            All the work was done on my customized theme.

                            Hired as the only front-end developer in the team.
                            I was creating advanced, responsive layouts for the whole service.
                            My views were attached to Yii framework and used by large audience.

                            Short term intern where I was required to work with both front-end and back-end.
                            Most of my tasks were special training projects or corrections in products.
                            I was also working quite a lot with wordpress customization.
